# Image classification

### Introduction

Let's start our journey into the world of computer vision with the task of image classification. Apart from the task, this chapter will also give you a head start to a bunch of other frameworks, libraries and tools that are commonly used by the machine learning community.

By the way, if you are not familiar with image classification, it's as simple as shown in the below image:

```{image} ./assets/img_clf_task.png
:alt: image_classification
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
```

As shown above, the model has to classify the image into the correct class/category that it belongs to.
