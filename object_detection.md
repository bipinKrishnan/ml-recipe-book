# Object detection

### Introduction

In this chapter we will talk about another task involving images as inputs, we will train a model to detect all objects in a given image, as shown in the below image:

```{image} ./assets/object_detect_img.png
:alt: object_detection
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
```

For this chapter we will train a model to detect cars in a given image. As shown above, the model should correctly detect all the cars in a given image by predicting the coordinates of the bounding box for the car.

```{image} ./assets/object_detect_model.png
:alt: object_detection
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
```

```{note}
If any part of the image is not clearly visible, you can toggle full screen mode from the top bar and zoom in 200% for better experience.
